# Transient_Classification
A project in which our team developed two different CNN models that classifies time series data from the NaI detectors on the Fermi GBM telescope into four transient categories, namely Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flash (TGFs), Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs), and Solar Flares (SFLARE).
